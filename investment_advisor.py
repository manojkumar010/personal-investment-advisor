with st.expander("What is a Mutual Fund?"):
    st.write("A mutual fund is a professionally managed investment fund that pools money from many investors to purchase securities like stocks, bonds, money market instruments, and other assets. Mutual funds are operated by money managers, who invest the fund's capital and attempt to produce capital gains and income for the fund's investors.")

with st.expander("What is SIP?"):
    st.write("SIP stands for Systematic Investment Plan. It is a method of investing a fixed amount regularly (e.g., monthly) into a mutual fund. SIPs help in rupee cost averaging and inculcate a disciplined approach to investing.")

with st.expander("How is 'Expected Annual Return' determined?"):
    st.write("The 'Expected Annual Return' is an estimated rate of return you anticipate from your investment. It's crucial to understand that this is a projection and actual returns can vary. Historical performance of similar funds or market conditions can be used as a guide, but past performance does not guarantee future results.")

with st.expander("Why are there different 'Risk Tolerances'?"):
    st.write("Risk tolerance refers to an investor's ability and willingness to take on financial risk. Different mutual fund categories carry different levels of risk. Understanding your risk tolerance helps in choosing funds that align with your comfort level and financial goals. Low risk tolerance typically means preferring stable, less volatile investments, while high risk tolerance may involve investments with higher potential returns but also higher potential losses.")

with st.expander("How accurate are the fund suggestions?"):
    st.write("The fund suggestions provided are based on general investment principles and common mutual fund categories. They are intended as a guide to help you understand which types of funds might align with your stated risk tolerance and investment goals. However, these are not financial recommendations. Always consult with a qualified financial advisor before making any investment decisions.")
